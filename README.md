## connect_aal_predict

A loose collection of scripts that take correlation matrices from the preprocessing pipeline, create a correlation vector for each participant, create a distance matrix (calculated from centroids derived from parcellations of the AAL atlas).

TO DO: 

Weight correlation vectors by distance (corr * dist) on assumption that strongly correlated long distance connections are "important".

Stich clinical information into the vector.
Dimensionality reduction.
Prediction.
...
PROFIT!
